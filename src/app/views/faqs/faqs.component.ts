        question: 'Which are the different types of loans available on the Credit Marketplace?',
        answer: `The RCN Credit Marketplace allows creditors to access multiple lending alternatives, including both DeFi & CeFi loans. These are the main differences between them:

• DeFi (Decentralized Finance) P2P loans are requested by retail borrowers within the crypto ecosystem. They are denominated in cryptocurrencies and backed by crypto-collateral locked in a smart-contract. The funds obtained through them are usually employed to finance the borrowers’ leveraged investments.

• CeFi (Centralized Finance) loans are requested by Originators, economic entities that exist beyond the crypto ecosystem. They are denominated in either fiat or crypto currencies, and backed by their borrower’s reputation. The funds obtained through them are usually applied to satisfy the Originators’ general financial requirements.`
      }, {
        question: 'Which is the most important information I should consider before funding a loan?',
        answer: `There are several pieces of information that you should consider before deciding to fund a loan, all of which can be found on the loan’s Detailed View. These include the following:

• The Borrower’s Ethereum wallet address, accompanied by a description and a set of relevant facts about it.

• The Borrowing Currency, which is the currency in which the loan and its interests are denominated.

• The Annual Rate (short for Annual Percentage Rate or APR), which is the annualized interest rate paid by the borrower and earned by the lender for funding the loan (without taking compound interest into account).

• The Penalty Rate, which is the interest rate that replaces the Annual Rate in CeFi loans once the Due Date has passed and the loan’s status has changed to Overdue. This rate is applied to both the principal and the interest accrued until that moment.

• The Lend amount, which is the amount the lender has to deposit in order to fund the loan, denominated in the Borrowing Currency. This amount can also be seen expressed in the chosen Lending Currency on the Loan Lending dialog.

• The Receive amount, which is the amount of capital plus interest the lender will receive for funding the loan, denominated in the Borrowing Currency. A possible value for this amount can also be seen expressed in the chosen Lending Currency on the Loan Lending dialog.

• The Duration, which indicates the amount of time the borrower has in order to repay the loan. The consequences of a delayed repayment depend on the loan type: in CeFi loans, the loan’s status will change to Overdue and the Penalty Rate will replace the Annual Rate as the current interest rate; in DeFi loans, the loan’s collateral will get partially liquidated to repay the accrued debt, with the remaining collateral being available for withdrawal after the loan has been fully repaid.

• The Instalments Schedule, which indicates the number, date and amount of the payments in which the Receive amount will be repaid. Each of these payments implies another due date in the loan’s repayment schedule.

• The Oracle, represented by its Ethereum address, which supplies the exchange rate used to calculate the equivalence between amounts denominated in the Borrowing and Lending Currencies.

• The Collateral Status, which offers several indicators related to the loan’s collateral, including the following:

  ◦ Collateral Amount, the amount of funds currently collateralized.

  ◦ Collateral Ratio, the proportion between the value of the collateral and the value of the borrowed funds.

  ◦ Liquidation Ratio, the value of the Collateral Ratio at which the collateral will get partially or fully liquidated.

  ◦ Safety Ratio, the value the Collateral Ratio will reach after a collateral liquidation.

  ◦ Current Exchange Rate, between the Collateralization Currency and the Borrowing Currency.

  ◦ Liquidation Exchange Rate, the exchange rate at which the Collateral Ratio will reach the Liquidation Ratio.

Most of these variables are set by the borrower as part of the loan requesting process.

        question: 'Which Lending Currencies can I use to fund a loan?',

        question: 'How can exchange rate fluctuations between the Borrowing and Lending Currencies affect the Receive amount?',
        answer: `While loans on the RCN Credit Marketplace can be funded in several Lending Currencies, they are always denominated in their Borrowing Currency. This means that while the Receive amount expressed in the Borrowing Currency is constant, if the exchange rate between a loan’s Borrowing and Lending Currencies fluctuates during its term, the Receive amount expressed in the Lending Currency will be different than the one originally estimated on the Loan Lending dialog. This can produce two different results, depending on how the exchange rate varies:

• If the exchange rate decreases, and the value of the Borrowing Currency (measured in the Lending Currency) at the end of the term is higher than the value at the beginning, the Receive amount expressed in the Lending Currency will be higher than the one originally estimated.

• If the exchange rate increases, and the value of the Borrowing Currency (measured in the Lending Currency) at the end of the term is lower than the value at the beginning, the Receive amount expressed in the Lending Currency will be lower than the one originally estimated.

In this second case, if the fluctuation is big enough, the Receive amount in the Lending Currency might end up being lower than the original Lend amount.`

        answer: 'You can find the most suitable loans for you more easily using the tools on the <a href="https://rcn.market/lend" target="_blank">Lend</a> section, which will allow you to filter them by Borrowing Currency, Lend amount, Duration and Annual Rate, and sort them by Receive amount, Annual Rate or Penalty Rate.'

Once you have verified its terms and made sure you understood them, click on the “Lend” button. When the pop-up dialog appears, choose the Lending Currency you want to fund the loan with and verify the Lend amount and the Receive amount in both the Lending Currency and the Borrowing Currency. Remember that while the Receive Amount expressed in the Borrowing Currency is not affected by exchange rate fluctuations, the Receive Amount expressed in the Lending Currency is, which means it can change. Finally, click on the “Lend” button, confirm the transaction on your wallet’s pop-up dialog and wait until the loading bar indicates that the process is complete. Once it is, you will be able to see your newly funded loan on the My Loans section, under the “Lent” tag.'

        question: 'What do the different Loan status mean?',
        answer: `All loans display a status which varies through their life cycle and offers important information about them. These include the following:

• A Requested status, which indicates that the loan has been requested by a borrower but not yet funded. Requested Loans give information about their duration but not about specific repayment dates, since those cannot be established until the loan has been funded.

• An Ongoing status, which indicates that the loan has been funded but not yet repaid. Ongoing Loans show their due dates and the time remaining until they arrive.

• An Overdue status, which indicates that one of the loan’s due dates has gone by without the loan being fully repaid. Overdue Loans show their due dates and the time passed since them. This status is only applicable to CeFi loans.

• A Repaid status, which indicates that the loan has been fully repaid.`
      }, {
        question: 'What happens if a DeFi loan’s Collateral Ratio drops too much?',
        answer: `A DeFi loan’s Collateral Ratio will fall if the value of its collateral decreases in relation to the value of the loan. If the Collateral Ratio drops to 150%, the loan’s collateral will get automatically liquidated (either in part or in full) to repay a portion of the debt, reducing both the Collateral Amount and the Outstanding Amount and reincreasing the Collateral Ratio until it reaches 200%.`
      }, {
        question: 'What happens if a loan is not repaid on time?',
        answer: `The consequences of a loan not being repaid by the time one of its due dates arrives depend on whether it is a DeFI or a CeFi loan:

• If a DeFi loan is not repaid on time its collateral will get partially or totally liquidated to repay the accrued debt. In order to preserve the collateral’s role as the lender’s protection against default, a partial or total collateral liquidation and debt repayment will also take place if the Collateral Ratio reaches the Liquidation Ratio. While a DeFi loan’s status will never change to Overdue, if the repayment is total the status will change to Repaid and no further debt will be accrued.

• If a CeFi loan is not repaid on time, its status will change to Overdue and the Penalty Rate will replace the Annual Rate as the loans’ interest rate. This rate will be applied to both the principal and the interest accrued so far. When the loan’s accrued debt is repaid, the status will change back to Outstanding and the Annual Rate will be reinstated. If the repayment is total, the status will change to Repaid and no further debt will be accrued.`

      }, {
        question: 'Can I fund loans using my previous unwithdrawn repaid funds?',

• The Borrowing Currency, which is the currency in which the loan and its interests are denominated.

• The Borrow amount, which is the amount the borrower is requesting, denominated in the Borrowing Currency.

• The Repay amount, which is the amount of capital plus interest the borrower has to pay back to fully repay a loan, denominated in the Borrowing Currency.

• The Annual Rate (short for Annual Percentage Rate or APR), which is the annualized interest rate paid by the borrower and earned by the lender for funding the loan (without taking compound interest into account).

• The Duration, which indicates the amount of time the borrower has in order to repay the loan before its collateral gets partially or totally liquidated to repay the accrued debt.

• The Instalments, which allow to pay the Repay amount in several, evenly distributed and equal payments, instead of in one unique final payment. Each of these payments implies another due date in the loan’s repayment schedule.

• The Expiration Time, which indicates the amount of time the loan request will remain active before expiring, if it isn’t funded by a lender.

• The Oracle, which supplies the exchange rate used to calculate the equivalence between the different currencies involved in a loan. This variable can be verified but not defined by the borrower.

• The Collateral Amount, which is the amount of funds the borrower is locking to back the loan.

• The Collateral Ratio, which is the proportion between the value of the collateral and the value of the borrowed funds.

• The Liquidation Exchange Rate, which is the exchange rate at which the Collateral Ratio will reach the Liquidation Ratio.

• The Liquidation Ratio, which is the value of the Collateral Ratio at which the collateral will get partially or fully liquidated. This variable can be verified but not defined by the borrower.

        question: 'How can I request a loan?',
        answer: `In order to request a loan, verify that you have sufficient funds in any of the available Collateralization Currencies, go to the <a href="https://rcn.market/borrow" target="_blank">Borrow</a> section and set your borrowing terms, including the Borrowing Currency, Amount, Duration, Annual Rate, Instalments and Expiration Time. When you are done check your selected terms (including the Repay amount), click on the “Create” button and approve your wallet’s transaction. Remember that your loan will not be available for lending until you supply your collateral, on the next step.

After closing your wallet’s transaction dialog, wait until the blue progress line disappears. Once it’s done you will find the required Collateralization Currency and Amount already displayed on the screen. The default Amount represents the quantity of collateral required to reach a 200% Collateral Ratio, which is the minimum allowed initial ratio between the value of your collateral and the value of your borrowed funds. While lower amounts won’t allow you to collateralize your loan, you can choose a higher amount to decrease your chances of facing a collateral liquidation (which will happen if your Collateral Ratio drops to 150%). Once you have set an amount click on the “Confirm” button, approve your wallet’s transaction and wait until the blue progress line disappears. Once it does, you will be able to see your newly requested loan on the My Loans section, under the “Borrowed” tag.

      }, {
        question: 'Why do I need to overcollateralize my loan?',
        answer: 'As most platforms with support for DeFi loans, the Credit Marketplace requires borrowers to deposit collateral to provide their lenders with a safeguard against potential defaults. Since most Collateralization Currencies are exposed to price variations (which can result in depreciations relative to the value of the Borrowing Currency), the Collateral Amount is always at risk of becoming less valuable than the Repay Amount, making itself unsuitable as the loan’s collateral. To prevent this, the Collateral Ratio must always be 150% or higher, with an initial value of at least 200%.'
      }, {
        question: 'Why do I have to approve two different transactions?',

      }, {
        question: 'What happens if my loan’s Collateral Ratio changes?',
        answer: `Your Collateral Ratio can change due to price fluctuations in your loan’s Borrowing Currency and Collateralization Currency, generating opposite consequences. If the value of your Collateralization Currency increases in relation to the value of your Borrowing Currency, your Collateral Ratio will grow. On the contrary, if the first one decreases, the second one will fall.

If your Collateral Ratio drops below 100%, it means that your collateral has become less valuable than your debt, making itself unsuitable as the loan’s collateral. To prevent this from happening, if the Collateral Ratio reaches 150% your collateral will get automatically liquidated to repay the debt, either partially or totally. This will reduce both your Collateral Amount and Outstanding Amount, returning your Collateral Ratio to 200%.`
